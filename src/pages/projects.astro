			<h3>Personal projects help you learn skills you didn't know you needed and they give you a chance to learn new frameworks or programming languages. By playing with code and having fun doing it, you're making yourself a better developer because you're still learning. They allow you to learn and gain recognition for yourself. They are one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal of things to do with your time. So as you look to the week ahead, perhaps consider creating or working on a side project.</h3>
