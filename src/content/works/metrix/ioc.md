  I created an IoC dependency injection container that enables the efficient management of object dependencies in software applications. By leveraging this pattern, the application can be designed to be modular, extensible, and easily testable. The container provides a central location for managing object creation and their dependencies, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of maintenance.
